 
       CROSS BROWSERS TESTS AND ISSUES SPECIFIED

  I had several issues with the brower testing
 The browsers i was using are : Chrome, Mozilla firefox, IE, Safari.
 
 first issue was my imgs (find me - footer) of Git and linkdin were not found, on all browsers
 except on IE were found. (captured img: png not found error 404).
 the code was written correctly and shows no errors but when opening the inspector it shows 2 errors of those 2 png images were not found.

 second issue was that on IE browser, all the sections part were messed up (you can see on the capture imgs of : work.html IE)
